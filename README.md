## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Commit all files to the repository root on `main`.
2. Settings > Pages > Source: **Deploy from a branch** > `main` / `(root)`.
3. The game is served at `https://<your-username>.github.io/orbital-command/`.

## Notes

- Links between pages and scripts are relative, so keep the folder layout above.
- Three.js loads from cdnjs. The menu globe loads NASA Earth textures from jsDelivr (three.js examples) and falls back to a generated globe if they cannot load.
- Earth imagery credit: NASA, as distributed with the three.js examples. Check the terms before store release.
- Progress and the Solar Sandbox fleet are saved in the browser (localStorage).
- **Offline / install:** after one online visit the pages, Three.js, fonts and Earth textures are cached, so the game runs offline and can be added to the home screen. Bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` (for example `oc-v2`) on each release so players get updates.
